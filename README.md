# Object_detection_app_yolov3
This project is made on Google Colab using yolov3 and OpenCV
In this project, I have used a pretrained yolov3 model and the opencv library for object detection. I have also included the javascript for accessing the webcam since colab is a cloud based platform and wont allow that by default. The code written is capable of detecting objects in images, videos, or even live video stream through webcam.
I have also used this code to create an app using streamlit which is a very cool platform for creating apps.
